# Ace Semiauto
 A FiveM resource that makes all weapons semi auto, and disables it for those with a specific ace permission.

## Installation
* Drop the folder ``ace-semiauto`` into your resources folder.
* Add `start ace-semiauto` in you server.cfg
* To set up **permissions**, use this ace permission for any of your groups
  * `LEO.FullAuto`
* Restart server

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** By default everyone is restricted to semi-auto fire. The ace permission `LEO.FullAuto` allows anyone to bypass semi-auto.
